# Welcome to My DOM Practice Website!
My goal when creating this project was to familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and most importantly, the **DOM** (Document Object Model). I had a ton of fun (and struggles) creating and messing around with this project, and I learned a lot about DOM manipulation throughout this process. I hope you enjoy checking it out!
